I'm pretty much\\noblivious to any current firmware problems, so you'll have to get it\\nfrom someone else.\\n\\nHowever, I can tell you to stay clear of any board which uses the\\nRockwell MPU (as opposed to the DPU) for an internal implementation.\\nThis is because the MPU used \\\"speed buffering\\\" instead of having a\\n16550 interface.  Without the 550 interface, the number of interrupts\\nare still the same and thus may get dropped under multitasking\\nconditions (like in windows).  As far as I know, the \\\"speed buffering\\\"\\nworks OK for external modems if a 550 is used on the internal serial\\nport board.\\n\\nHope this helps...\\nTom\\n\\n-- \\n|Tom Barrett (TDBear), Sr. Engineer|tom.barrett@amd.com|v:512-462-6856 |\\n|AMD PCD MS-520 | 5900 E.

These electric fields change with location\\nand time in a large organism.  Special photographic techniques such as applying\\nexternal fields in Kirillian photography interact with these fields or the resistances\\ncaused by these fields to make interesting pictures. Perhaps such pictures will\\nbe diagonistic of disease problems in organisms when better understood. Perhaps not.\\n\\nStudying the overall electric activity of biological systems is several hundred\\nyears old, but not a popular activity.  Perhaps, except in the case of a few\\ntissues like nerves and the electric senses of fishes, it is hard to reduce the\\ninvestigation into small pieces that can be clearly analyzed.  There are some\\nhints that manipulating electric fields is a useful therapy such as speeding\\nthe healing of broken bones, but not understood why.\\n\\nBioelectricity has a long association with mysticism. Ideas such as Frankenstein\\nreanimation go back to the most early electrical experiments on tissue such as\\nwhen Volta invented the battery.  I personally don't care to revert to supernatural\\ncause to explain things we don't yet understand.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n

But it rather\\ndepends on what the 'certain circumstances' are.  When you talk about\\nChristianity, or Islam, then at least your claims can be understood.\\nIt's when people go to a general statement about theism that it falls\\napart.

If they were doing it because of some obscure\\npoint of theology, then yes.  But since all protestants don't do this\\n(nor do they elect extremists to do it for them), it's just too broad\\ntoo say \\\"religion did this\\\".  I'm saying that the causes are far more\\ncomplex than that - take away the religious element, and you'd still\\nhave the powerful motives of revenge and misguided patriotism.

These electric fields change with location\\nand time in a large organism.  Special photographic techniques such as applying\\nexternal fields in Kirillian photography interact with these fields or the resistances\\ncaused by these fields to make interesting pictures. Perhaps such pictures will\\nbe diagonistic of disease problems in organisms when better understood. Perhaps not.\\n\\nStudying the overall electric activity of biological systems is several hundred\\nyears old, but not a popular activity.  Perhaps, except in the case of a few\\ntissues like nerves and the electric senses of fishes, it is hard to reduce the\\ninvestigation into small pieces that can be clearly analyzed.  There are some\\nhints that manipulating electric fields is a useful therapy such as speeding\\nthe healing of broken bones, but not understood why.\\n\\nBioelectricity has a long association with mysticism.

reactions 2 promote communication of states with in a cell\\n3 communicate between cells of which the nervous system is a specialized\\nexample and perhaps other uses  these electric fields change with location\\nand time in a large organism  special photographic techniques such as applying\\nexternal fields in kirillian photography interact with these fields or the resistances\\ncaused by these fields to make interesting pictures perhaps such pictures will\\nbe diagonistic of disease problems in organisms when better understood perhaps not\\n\\nstudying the overall electric activity of biological systems is several hundred\\nyears old but not a popular activity  perhaps except in the case of a few\\ntissues like nerves and the electric senses of fishes it is hard to reduce the\\ninvestigation into small pieces that can be clearly analyzed  there are some\\nhints that manipulating electric fields is a useful therapy such as speeding\\nthe healing of broken bones but not understood why\\n\\nbioelectricity has a long association with mysticism ideas such as frankenstein\\nreanimation go back to the most early electrical experiments on tissue such as\\nwhen volta

I'm pretty much\\noblivious to any current firmware problems, so you'll have to get it\\nfrom someone else.\\n\\nHowever, I can tell you to stay clear of any board which uses the\\nRockwell MPU (as opposed to the DPU) for an internal implementation.\\nThis is because the MPU used \\\"speed buffering\\\" instead of having a\\n16550 interface.  Without the 550 interface, the number of interrupts\\nare still the same and thus may get dropped under multitasking\\nconditions (like in windows).  As far as I know, the \\\"speed buffering\\\"\\nworks OK for external modems if a 550 is used on the internal serial\\nport board.\\n\\nHope this helps...\\nTom\\n\\n-- \\n|Tom Barrett (TDBear), Sr. Engineer|tom.barrett@amd.com|v:512-462-6856 |\\n|AMD PCD MS-520 | 5900 E.

These electric fields change with location\\nand time in a large organism.  Special photographic techniques such as applying\\nexternal fields in Kirillian photography interact with these fields or the resistances\\ncaused by these fields to make interesting pictures. Perhaps such pictures will\\nbe diagonistic of disease problems in organisms when better understood. Perhaps not.\\n\\nStudying the overall electric activity of biological systems is several hundred\\nyears old, but not a popular activity.  Perhaps, except in the case of a few\\ntissues like nerves and the electric senses of fishes, it is hard to reduce the\\ninvestigation into small pieces that can be clearly analyzed.  There are some\\nhints that manipulating electric fields is a useful therapy such as speeding\\nthe healing of broken bones, but not understood why.\\n\\nBioelectricity has a long association with mysticism.
